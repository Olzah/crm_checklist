    CRM Odoo Checklist
    ==============
    A checklist is like a roadmap made up of tasks or items to be completed. 
    It's a tool that helps you stay organized by breaking down larger tasks into smaller, 
    manageable steps. Checking off each item as you go helps ensure nothing is missed and keeps you on track toward your goals.
